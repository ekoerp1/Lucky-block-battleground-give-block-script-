Here is the script

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekoerp1/Lucky-block-battleground-give-block-script-/main/script", true))()

I made this in like 40 seconds ill try to update it long term to look better but it works rn

Also void block is just 3 galixy and 2 rainbow blocks so I didnt add it
